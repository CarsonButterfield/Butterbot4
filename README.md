# Butterbot4
A stats and administration bot for Discord servers
Butterbot is built to make managing large scale discord servers easier than ever. It provides numerous tools and utilities to help you keep your server well moderated, growing, and healthy.
The first way it does this is by collecting information on how the server is being used. Stuff like which channels are most popular, when is the server most active, what portion of your members are regularly active, and more.
All of this information is accessible through the Butterbot website (not yet live). The website allows you to see all this inforation in easily digestible charts and graphs, as opposed to most bots text only outputs.
But the website doesnt only allow for you to see data, it also allows you to customize the powerfull automoderator built into Butterbot.
A note to any potential employers looking at this repo. Butterbot4 is still in very early, experimental stages. Most of the core functioanlity is finished and it is currently being intigrated with the front end, that being said there is some messy, strange code that still needs to be cleaned up.
Here is a link to the front end repository.
